Module: CraftEnemyHealthBarModule

This is **disabled** by default, when enabled you will see the health of the last attacked enemy as a bossbar. Please note that there are multiple bossbars already in use (Offhand, Status effects) so you will end up with a really cluttered screen.

The following colors are available: BLUE, GREEN, AQUA, RED, PURPLE, YELLOW, WHITE, BLACK

| Option | Type | Description |
