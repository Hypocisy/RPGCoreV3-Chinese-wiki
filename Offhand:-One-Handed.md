Module: Items, Offhand

You may dual-wield two one-handed weapons. Only weapons explicitly marked to be one-handed can be dual-wielded. While dual wielding, your attack speed is 120% of the average of both weapons. The attack speed cooldown is shared between your offhand and main-hand. The combat configuration is used based upon the weapon you use. Only the melee configuration is used like this.
