Prepares the targets read by the [[Selected]] targetter, try to run the [[Selected]] targetter once before you feed the targets. If by any chance you didn't finish running the previous ability (iE Interrupted, Out of mana) you'll end up with being fed the previous targets. This is meant to be used in combination with channeling. **Only use this with self-casting.** It applies directly on the entity who cast it, should it be a player.
