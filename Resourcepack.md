RPAssist merely is meant to make it easier for you to handle resourcepacks and their updates. If you find it to be too much a challenge to utilize it, you do not **not** need to. The purpose of RPAssist is to make it compile a resourcepack and send it to the player.

There is a "finished_resourcepack.zip" shipped, you can upload to your dropbox and update your server.properties with it. Do not ask for additional support on how to get this working.

**If you do not use RPAssist do not keep it on the server.**

Beneath is a copy of the latest readme for RPAssist.

Other Important Notices:
 + RPAssistant is a plugin, add it to "server/plugins"
 + Not adding a dropbox token will just create a resourcepack file.
 + Do not upload anything into the dropbox, RPAssistant handles everything
 + When updating, delete the "DO_NOT_UPLOAD" file in the folder
 + The template.zip needs to be zipped up manually, make sure that you do NOT
   accidentally create a "template.zip/template/assets", it has to be like 
   "template.zip/assets"

If you cannot get RPAssist to work, just set the resource-pack in your server.properties! RPAssist only
 compiles a resourcepack in your place and sends it to the player. You don't need to keep it on the server.
 there is a "finished_resourcepack.zip", it is the latest compiled state of RPAssist.
