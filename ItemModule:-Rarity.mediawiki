Module: ItemModule

Item rarity is not hard coded, however modifying it will require to match **several** configuration files for it. Beneath you can find a listing of all modules and configuration files that are affected by item rarity. This list may not be accurate at all times.

Warning: **All items roll a rarity upon being created.** You cannot modify the item rarity of an existing item.

* Item Configurations.  
** All items from the item module may have an rarity defined (when undefined, uses default weighting)
** Socketable jewels may have an item with a rarity setup.
** Itemized skills may have an item with a rarity setup.
* ItemModule Configurations.  
** You need to add the default weighting for the rarity, if it can happen "randomly"
** You need to add/update the item rarity mappings for extra benefits.
** You need to update the configuration to add a naming pattern for the item.
* ItemPointerModule Configurations.  
** Update the mappings that relate to item rarity

Item rarity on itself does not offer any specific effects, just what is defined by the specific details above. Stuff like extra sockets or additional slots for affixes.
