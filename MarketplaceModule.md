The marketplace plugin allows players to trade with each other, using [[ItemModule: Materials]] as the exchange currency. For this to work properly you should have worldguard to restrict where a player can place their trading chest. The trading works while offline, but is not retained after the server shuts down.

The only thing you need to configure are tab completion options, which also restricts what players may trade with.
