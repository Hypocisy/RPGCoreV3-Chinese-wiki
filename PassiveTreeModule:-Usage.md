Module: PassiveTreeModule, LevelModule

Depending on interpretation, a passive tree also could be considered a class. If you design accordingly, you could build up a system for class advancements after passing a certain level.

## Acquiring passive points

Usage of the passive tree requires players to gain passive points. When you level up, you acquire passive points. You may receive additional points from commands. You also need refunding points, currently only acquired from the command. When you got points, you can invest them into the respective passive nodes.

## Acquiring passive trees

Additional passive trees are unlocked once you gain a certain type of passive points. Just opening your passive tree after you have acquired points of another type is sufficient to present you with your advancement options.

## Navigate passive trees

Should you own multiple passive trees, hitting the icon (visible to the left) you can scroll through them. You "own" a passive tree, should you have a node assigned in it. Should you be an admin, Hitting the switch below the icon enables you to scroll thorough every passive tree registered on your server.

_Controls for navigating inside a tree are presented to the top left._
