Module: PassiveTreeModule, SkillModule, LevelModule

Depending on interpretation, a passive tree also could be considered a class. If you design accordingly, you could build up a system for class advancements after passing a certain level.

Usage of the passive tree requires players to gain passive points. When you level up, you acquire passive points. You may receive additional points from commands. You also need refunding points, currently only acquired from the command. When you got points, you can invest them into the respective passive nodes.

Additional passive trees are unlocked once you pass a certain level. Just opening your passive tree after you have acquired points of another type is sufficient to present you with your advancement options.
