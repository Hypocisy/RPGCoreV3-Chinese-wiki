Coloring is a system mostly in context with socketing. When you want to socket a skill on an item, the skill needs to match in color. If you want to socket a jewel on an item, the jewel needs to match in color. A red skill can only be socketed on a red socket, a blue skill can only be socket on a blue socket and so on.

White is a special case here, should the item to be socketed or the target slot be white in color it will skip the validation. White also is the default coloring, so you can ignore this page should you not want to add the coloring to your server.
